# Week 4: Resources
---
Gather the resources for your app. Locate the pictures, music files, and any other resources you want for your app and store them in a folder. You do not need to start creating any of the pages yet. Submit a word document listing the resources you will be using.

A folder containing the resources will be due this week.
