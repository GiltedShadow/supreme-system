# Week 7: QA Testing
---
Find one or two people (other than yourself), to test your app and deliver detailed feedback. Be sure that each person who tests your app fills out a sheet that lets you know what is visually and mechanically wrong with your app and turns that sheet into you when they are finished. These QA sheets will be created by you. Use the QA sheets to improve your app.

Create QA sheets and give out app for feedback to people to test your app, use those QA sheets to improve your app, those sheets and updated app will be turned in.
