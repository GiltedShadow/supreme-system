# Week 2: Design Brief
---
Research apps to determine the type of app you would like to create. The app should be one page with images, input, and feedback. Review colors, styles, and design for your app.

No deliverables to be turned in this week, and class has been changed so no deliverables aside from the final project is required. I will run the project as is in GitHub here.
