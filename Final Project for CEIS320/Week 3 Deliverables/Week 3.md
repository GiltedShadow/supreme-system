# Week 3: Design Brief
---
Write a two paragraph page describing your app. Define what the main concept of the app is and specific details of the app, such as how the app will be used, how a user will interface with the app, and the target audience of the app.

2 paragraphs are due this week as described above.

Whoops, totally forgot since it wasn't a grade but here goes

    My app will be a semi-standalone companion for any tabletop or board game that the user will also be playing, and will contain the ability to roll the majority of dice types as well as an "x amount of" specific dice. In order to show transparency a goal will be to have some form of transcript while using the app that will store several uses of the app, like will overwrite after 3 uses or so many lines of data. At this point, there will be a split for large dice games like DnD5e, PathFinder, and a generalized usage for any non-major or non-standard game style including board games.

    Interaction will be fairly simple, with buttons for the majority of the action or dice rolls, and numbered dice rolls (x amount of dice) will have a few selections as well as a custom fill in the blank. The dice roll displays will be separated to not overwrite them just in case they need to be added together - eg. the d2 will only overwrite the d2 display and so on. Beyond the simple displays for the dice options, there will be some splash screens that will reflect the game being selected.
